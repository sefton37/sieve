# No One Relevancy Rubric

## Purpose

This document is a reference for scoring news articles on their relevance to a set of interconnected analytical themes. Use it to evaluate each article and assign a relevance score that enables prioritized summarization. Articles with higher relevance scores should receive deeper analysis and earlier attention in any reporting pipeline.

The perspective described here is secular and systems-oriented. It examines how power, attention, autonomy, and cooperation function across technology, economics, governance, and culture. The name "No One" refers not to nihilism but to a design principle: systems should serve everyone without being captured by anyone.

---

## Core Axioms

These are the foundational premises. Every scoring dimension below derives from one or more of these axioms.

### 1. Attention Is Finite Cognitive Labor

Human attention is metabolically expensive, temporally finite, and generative. Every moment of conscious engagement produces value — patterns, data, decisions, culture. When systems extract this labor without acknowledgment or compensation, they exploit the most fundamental human resource.

**Pattern signals:** Articles discussing screen time, algorithmic engagement, behavioral manipulation, dopamine-driven design, infinite scroll mechanics, notification systems, advertising models built on captured attention, or the cognitive costs of information overload.

### 2. Sovereignty Is the Right to Choose Without Coercion

Individual and collective autonomy — the capacity to make informed, uncoerced decisions about one's own attention, data, body, labor, and participation — is the baseline condition for human dignity. Systems that erode sovereignty through manipulation, opacity, or asymmetric power are structurally harmful regardless of intent.

**Pattern signals:** Articles discussing consent mechanisms, informed choice, data ownership, privacy legislation, autonomy in healthcare or education, opt-in vs. opt-out design, right to repair, platform lock-in, or coercive defaults.

### 3. Fear Is the Primary Extraction Mechanism

Fear — of scarcity, exclusion, irrelevance, or harm — is the engine that drives compliance with extractive systems. Fear-based architectures produce information distortions, suppress dissent, and optimize for control rather than wellbeing. This pattern operates identically in authoritarian governance, corporate management, algorithmic content curation, and economic policy.

**Pattern signals:** Articles discussing manufactured urgency, crisis exploitation, scarcity narratives used to justify consolidation, outrage-driven engagement, anxiety as a product feature, fearmongering in media or politics, or whistleblower retaliation.

### 4. Transparency Over Opacity

Systems that resist inspection tend toward capture. Accountability requires that the rules, incentives, and consequences of any system be visible to the people affected by it. Opacity protects incumbents; transparency distributes power.

**Pattern signals:** Articles discussing algorithmic transparency, open-source governance, regulatory disclosure, black-box decision systems, freedom of information, corporate secrecy, classified overreach, or audit mechanisms.

### 5. Invitation Over Coercion

Durable cooperation emerges from voluntary participation, not compelled compliance. Systems designed around invitation — where participation is meaningful, exit is possible, and consent is ongoing — outperform coercive systems on resilience, trust, and long-term stability.

**Pattern signals:** Articles discussing voluntary frameworks, cooperative models, mutual aid, community governance, interoperability, platform portability, right to exit, or the failure of coercive policies.

### 6. Power Consolidation Is the Central Risk

The concentration of decision-making authority, economic resources, information access, or technological capability into fewer hands is the recurring structural threat across all domains. This applies equally to state actors, corporations, platforms, and individuals. The specific ideology of the consolidator is less important than the structural fact of consolidation.

**Pattern signals:** Articles discussing monopoly, oligopoly, regulatory capture, wealth concentration, single points of failure, centralized control of infrastructure, media consolidation, vertical integration, or the merger of state and corporate power.

### 7. Systems Shape Behavior More Than Intentions Do

Individual moral character matters less than the incentive structures people operate within. Well-designed systems produce beneficial outcomes from ordinary human behavior; poorly designed systems produce harmful outcomes from well-intentioned people. Analysis should focus on structural incentives rather than individual virtue or villainy.

**Pattern signals:** Articles discussing incentive design, unintended consequences, systemic reform, institutional failure, perverse incentives, moral hazard, regulatory design, or the gap between stated mission and structural outcome.

## Scoring Dimensions

Score each article on the following seven dimensions. Each dimension maps to one or more core axioms.

### D1: Attention Economy (Axioms 1, 3, 6)

Does the article address how human attention is captured, monetized, manipulated, or defended?

- **High relevance:** Behavioral advertising models, algorithmic curation decisions, screen time and cognitive health, attention as economic input, engagement optimization, addiction by design.
- **Medium relevance:** Social media policy, content moderation debates, creator economy dynamics, digital wellness tools.
- **Low relevance:** General technology product reviews, entertainment industry news without systemic framing.

### D2: Data Sovereignty and Digital Rights (Axioms 2, 4, 6)

Does the article address ownership, control, or governance of personal data and digital identity?

- **High relevance:** Data ownership legislation, surveillance capitalism, biometric data collection, AI training data provenance, data portability rights, digital identity systems, consent frameworks.
- **Medium relevance:** Privacy policy changes, data breach reports, GDPR enforcement, cookie consent evolution.
- **Low relevance:** General cybersecurity without a rights or sovereignty framing.

### D3: Power Consolidation and Institutional Capture (Axioms 5, 6, 7)

- **High relevance:** Cooperative economic models, mutual aid networks, community governance, non-coercive policy design, platform cooperativism, open-source as governance model, consent-based frameworks.
- **Medium relevance:** Labor organizing, union activity, international cooperation agreements, commons management.
- **Low relevance:** General business partnerships, trade agreements without structural analysis.

### D5: Fear-Based vs. Trust-Based Systems (Axioms 3, 7)

Does the article address how fear or trust function as organizing principles within institutions, markets, or cultures?

- **High relevance:** Organizational cultures of fear producing information distortion, manufactured scarcity, outrage economics, crisis profiteering, whistleblower dynamics, psychological safety research, trust as competitive advantage.
- **Medium relevance:** Workplace culture reporting, consumer confidence metrics, media sensationalism critique.
- **Low relevance:** General business management advice, market sentiment without systemic framing.

### D6: Democratization of Tools and Access (Axioms 1, 2, 6)

Does the article address the distribution or restriction of access to technology, knowledge, or capability?

- **High relevance:** Open-source AI, local-first computing, technology sovereignty, digital divide, right to repair, decentralized infrastructure, community broadband, knowledge commons, small-model AI democratization.
- **Medium relevance:** Education technology, public library systems, net neutrality, affordable hardware initiatives.
- **Low relevance:** Consumer gadget launches, premium service tier announcements.

### D7: Systemic Design and Incentive Architecture (Axioms 5, 6, 7)

Does the article address how structural incentives — rather than individual actors — produce outcomes?

- **High relevance:** Policy design that changes behavioral defaults, market mechanism reform, constitutional or governance architecture, feedback loops in economic or social systems, unintended consequences of regulation, systems thinking applied to real problems.
- **Medium relevance:** Policy debate coverage with structural framing, institutional reform proposals.
- **Low relevance:** Coverage focused entirely on individual blame or praise without systemic context.

## Composite Scoring Method

### Per-Dimension Scoring

For each of the seven dimensions (D1–D7), assign a score:

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0 | No relevance to this dimension |
| 1 | Tangential or implicit relevance |
| 2 | Moderate relevance — dimension is present but not central |
| 3 | High relevance — dimension is a primary theme of the article |

### Composite Score Calculation

```
composite = sum(D1 through D7)
```

**Score range:** 0–21

| Range | Priority Tier | Action |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| 15–21 | Tier 1 — Critical | Full analysis and summary. Multiple dimensions intersect. |
| 10–14 | Tier 2 — High | Detailed summary with dimension callouts. |
| 5–9 | Tier 3 — Notable | Brief summary noting relevant dimensions. |
| 1–4 | Tier 4 — Peripheral | Log with tags. Summarize only if volume permits. |
| 0 | Tier 5 — Skip | No relevance. Do not summarize. |

### Bonus: Dimensional Intersection

Articles that score 2+ on five or more dimensions simultaneously are more valuable than their raw score suggests. These represent **convergence points** — stories where attention economy, power consolidation, sovereignty, and systemic design interact. Flag these for priority analysis regardless of raw composite.

## Keyword and Signal Mapping

Use these keyword clusters to accelerate initial triage against the article's `keywords` field before deeper content analysis.

### High-Signal Keywords

These keywords, when present in article keywords or summary, strongly suggest relevance:

- **Attention/extraction:** attention economy, engagement metrics, algorithmic feed, behavioral advertising, screen time, dopamine design, infinite scroll, dark patterns, persuasive technology
- **Sovereignty/rights:** data ownership, digital rights, cognitive sovereignty, informed consent, data portability, right to delete, surveillance, biometric, facial recognition, digital identity
- **Power/consolidation:** monopoly, antitrust, vertical integration, regulatory capture, oligopoly, market concentration, platform power, walled garden, gatekeeping, too big to fail
- **Coercion/cooperation:** cooperative, mutual aid, commons, open source, interoperability, decentralized, federated, community governance, collective bargaining, platform cooperativism
- **Fear/trust:** manufactured crisis, outrage, fearmongering, scarcity narrative, whistleblower, psychological safety, organizational fear, crisis exploitation, trust deficit
- **Democratization:** open source, local-first, right to repair, digital divide, community broadband, small model, edge computing, self-hosted, technology sovereignty
- **Systems/incentives:** incentive design, perverse incentive, unintended consequences, moral hazard, systemic risk, feedback loop, structural reform, institutional failure, governance architecture

### Context-Dependent Keywords

These require content-level analysis to determine relevance:

- **AI/ML:** Relevant when framed in terms of power, access, training data rights, labor displacement, or consolidation. Less relevant when purely technical benchmarking.
- **Regulation/legislation:** Relevant when addressing structural power dynamics. Less relevant when procedural or narrowly technical.
- **Climate/environment:** Relevant when framed as systemic design failure, commons governance, or intergenerational coercion. Less relevant as isolated weather reporting.
- **Healthcare:** Relevant when addressing access as sovereignty, pharmaceutical consolidation, or mental health as systemic outcome. Less relevant as clinical trial results without systemic framing.
- **Education:** Relevant when addressing knowledge democratization, institutional gatekeeping, or attention management. Less relevant as institutional rankings or scheduling.
- **Military/defense:** Relevant when addressing surveillance infrastructure, autonomous weapons governance, or state power consolidation. Less relevant as equipment procurement or tactical reporting.

### Low-Signal Keywords

These rarely indicate relevance on their own and should not elevate scoring without supporting content:

- Celebrity, entertainment, sports scores, product launch (without systemic framing), earnings report (without concentration analysis), weather, routine election coverage (without structural analysis), individual crime reporting

## Analysis Guidelines

When generating summaries for high-scoring articles, structure the analysis around these questions:

1. **What is being consolidated or distributed?** Identify whether the article describes concentration or dispersal of power, resources, access, or decision-making authority.

2. **Who bears the cost and who captures the value?** Trace the flow of attention, labor, data, or resources. Identify asymmetries between who produces value and who profits from it.

3. **What incentive structure is at work?** Look past individual actors to the system that shapes their behavior. What would a rational actor do given these incentives, regardless of moral intention?

4. **Is sovereignty expanding or contracting?** Determine whether the development increases or decreases the capacity of individuals and communities to make informed, uncoerced choices.

5. **What is the fear, and who benefits from it?** Identify any scarcity narrative, urgency framing, or threat construction, and trace who profits from the resulting compliance.

6. **What would invitation-based design look like here?** Consider what the non-coercive alternative would be — the system that achieves similar goals through voluntary participation and transparent incentives.

## Edge Cases and Calibration Notes

- **Technology optimism without structural analysis** should score low. Announcements of new capabilities matter only insofar as they shift power, access, or sovereignty.

- **Outrage framing without systemic context** should score low. Articles designed to provoke emotional reaction without illuminating structural dynamics are themselves examples of attention extraction, not analysis of it.

- **Individual hero or villain narratives** should score lower than structural analyses of the same events. The question is never "who did this" but "what system made this the rational thing to do."

- **Both-sides framing that obscures power asymmetry** should be noted. False balance between a consolidating power and those affected by consolidation is itself a structural phenomenon worth flagging.

- **International perspective matters.** The same dynamics of consolidation, extraction, and sovereignty play out across all geographies and political systems. Relevance is not limited to any single country or political tradition.

- **Positive developments score high too.** Articles about successful cooperative models, effective regulation, tools that expand access, or communities reclaiming sovereignty are just as relevant as articles about consolidation and extraction. The rubric measures proximity to the themes, not valence.
